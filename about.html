        <p class="text-element about">*Please note that this page uses the Google Maps API and, although it
            has been told to prefer trains (plus subway), I can't prevent it from occasionally using
            buses or trams instead.

        <p class="text-element about">When used here, Google's API returns the time it takes to make the journey in
            question at the time of the search. Results may vary depending on whether you're searching, for example,
            at 9 AM Monday morning or 11 PM Sunday night.

        <p class="text-element about">To search for another route in the same country, just choose new departure and
            arrival points from the dropdown menus and click the buttons in order again. To reset the site so you can
            go to another country, click "Reset" in the upper right.
